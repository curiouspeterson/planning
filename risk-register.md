# Strategic Risk Register

<!-- Comprehensive risk register for Signature Med Support, identifying potential risks, assessing their impact, and outlining mitigation strategies to protect strategic goals. Last updated: 2025-05-18 -->

## Purpose
This risk register consolidates all significant strategic, operational, financial, and compliance risks identified across our business planning documents. It serves as a central reference for risk management, ensuring all identified risks have clear ownership and mitigation strategies.

## How to Use
1. **Review regularly:** Minimum quarterly, preferably monthly
2. **Update proactively:** When new risks are identified in any planning document or meeting
3. **Reference in planning:** Consider these risks when developing new strategies or service offerings
4. **Track effectiveness:** Monitor whether mitigation strategies are working as intended
5. **Cross-reference:** Link to specific tasks in tasks.md that address risk mitigation

## Risk Monitoring Process

### Regular Review Schedule
- **Weekly:** Review any critical risks in leadership team meetings
- **Monthly:** Comprehensive review of high risks and update mitigation progress 
- **Quarterly:** Full review of all risks, including reassessment of probability and impact

### Risk Escalation Protocol
1. **Risk Level Increase:** If any risk increases in level (e.g., from Medium to High), immediately notify risk owner and leadership team
2. **Mitigation Failure:** If a mitigation strategy proves ineffective, escalate to CEO for immediate alternative strategy development
3. **New Critical Risks:** Any newly identified critical risks require immediate leadership team notification and mitigation planning

### Documentation Requirements
1. Record all risk-related incidents and near-misses
2. Document effectiveness of mitigation strategies
3. Update risk register with any new risks identified through operations
4. Cross-reference new tasks created to address risks

## Next Steps
1. **Assign responsible team member to each risk**
2. **Create specific tasks in tasks.md for risks lacking mitigation tasks**
3. **Develop detailed mitigation plans for all Critical and High risks**
4. **Establish regular risk review meetings**
5. **Create risk reporting dashboard for leadership visibility**
