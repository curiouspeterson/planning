- **Important + Not Urgent (Schedule):** Medium-High priority tasks that are important for long-term success
- **Urgent + Not Important (Delegate):** Medium priority tasks that need attention but aren't strategically critical
- **Not Urgent + Not Important (Eliminate/Defer):** Low priority tasks that can be delayed or reconsidered
