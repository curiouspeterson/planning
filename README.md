# Cursor-Optimized Business Planning System

<!-- Updated to document the enhanced business planning system with advanced gap detection, complexity analysis, visual progress tracking, and integrated validation mechanisms. Last updated: 2025-05-17 -->

## Overview

This repository contains the core planning documents and support scripts for Signature Med Support's business planning system. The system is optimized for use with Cursor IDE, providing a streamlined approach to business planning, task tracking, and strategic assessment.

## Document Structure

The planning system consists of the following key documents:

- **master-plan.md**: The North Star document that outlines the grand vision, long-term goals, and strategic direction
- **tasks.md**: A comprehensive list of actionable tasks with priority, complexity, status, assignment, and deadline information
- **next-steps.md**: Short to medium-term priorities and focus areas derived from the master plan
- **accomplishments.md**: Record of completed tasks and achievements
- **learnings.md**: Insights, discoveries, and knowledge gained through the business development process
- **overview.md**: Executive summary and high-level overview of the business and planning system
- **competitor-analysis.md**: Detailed analysis of key competitors in the travel risk management space
- **seo-strategy.md**: Strategy for online visibility and digital marketing

## Automation Scripts

The `/scripts` directory contains automation tools to help maintain consistency across planning documents:

- **daily-review.sh**: Performs daily checks on task statuses and document consistency
- **three-day-review.sh**: Provides a deeper document consistency analysis on a 3-day schedule
- **weekly-assessment.sh**: Conducts a comprehensive strategic assessment with advanced visualization and gap analysis
- **check-consistency.sh**: Verifies alignment between documents with enhanced detection of complex tasks, KPI tracking, and risk management
- **generate-status-report.sh**: Creates detailed business status reports
- **planning_automation.py**: Advanced Python tool for comprehensive planning verification, gap detection, and validation

## Cursor Optimizations

The system includes several Cursor-specific optimizations in the `.cursor/rules` directory:

- **project-overview.mdc**: Rules for maintaining the project overview
- **task-template.mdc**: Templates for adding new tasks with complexity assessment
- **business-reports.mdc**: Guidelines for generating business reports
- **file-updates.mdc**: Rules for maintaining file headers and update records
- **cursor-optimization.mdc**: Enhanced configuration for YOLO mode, Command K shortcuts, document testing, and interactive guidance
- **document-sync.mdc**: Advanced rules for document synchronization, consistency verification, and dependency tracking

## Templates

The `/templates` directory contains standardized templates for:

- Task creation and breakdown
- Business reporting and analysis
- Strategic assessments and reviews
- Competitor analysis
- Service launch planning

## Reports

The `/reports` directory stores generated reports from the system for:

- Weekly status updates and assessments
- Monthly business reviews
- Quarterly strategic assessments
- Planning verification results
- Gap analysis reports

## How to Use

### Daily Operations

1. Open the planning system in Cursor
2. Run the daily review script: `./scripts/daily-review.sh`
3. Review any flagged inconsistencies or issues
4. Update task statuses in `tasks.md`
5. Document any new learnings in `learnings.md`

### Task Management

1. View current tasks in `tasks.md`
2. Update task status by changing the "Status" field:
   - To Do: Not started
   - In Progress: Currently being worked on
   - Done: Completed
   - Blocked: Unable to proceed due to dependencies
3. Assess task complexity using the provided guidelines:
   - High: Multiple components, significant dependencies, or specialized expertise
   - Medium: Moderate complexity with some dependencies
   - Low: Straightforward with minimal dependencies
4. Break down high complexity tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks
5. When marking a task as "Done", add it to `accomplishments.md` with relevant details
6. Review `next-steps.md` regularly to align work with current priorities

### Strategic Reviews

1. Run the weekly assessment script: `./scripts/weekly-assessment.sh`
2. Review the strategic alignment between documents and visual progress indicators
3. Address identified gaps in KPI tracking mechanisms
4. Update the master plan as needed to reflect evolving business strategy
5. Run the planning verification script for detailed gap analysis: `./scripts/planning_automation.py`
6. Adjust `next-steps.md` to reflect new priorities
7. Create new tasks in `tasks.md` based on updated priorities

### Document Consistency

1. Run the consistency check script: `./scripts/check-consistency.sh`
2. Address any highlighted inconsistencies:
   - Update document headers with current date
   - Ensure strategic goals are referenced consistently across documents
   - Verify task dependencies and references
   - Align terminology across all documents
   - Ensure completed tasks are properly documented in accomplishments
   - Break down complex tasks into manageable components

## YOLO Mode Configuration

When using Cursor's YOLO mode with this planning system, configure the prompt to:

```
Automatically update related documents when changes occur according to document-sync rules. Verify document headers are updated with current dates. Maintain consistency across master-plan.md, next-steps.md, and tasks.md. Run document consistency tests when appropriate. Flag complex tasks for breakdown and identify potential planning gaps.
```

## Command K Shortcuts

Use the following Command K patterns for quick operations:

- "Move this task to accomplishments" - Transfers completed task to accomplishments.md
- "Update task status to [status]" - Updates task status in tasks.md
- "Create tasks from this learning" - Generates actionable tasks from learnings
- "Break down complex task" - Divides a high complexity task into smaller components
- "Assess task complexity" - Evaluates and assigns complexity level to a task
- "Update related documents" - Updates connected documents based on this change
- "Update header with today's date" - Updates the document header timestamp
- "Verify consistency with master plan" - Checks alignment with strategic goals
- "Check for planning gaps" - Identifies strategic goals without implementing tasks
- "Create KPI tracking task" - Generates a task for tracking a specific KPI
- "Run daily review" - Executes daily review process
- "Run three-day review" - Performs comprehensive document consistency check
- "Run weekly assessment" - Conducts strategic assessment
- "Run planning verification" - Performs detailed gap analysis
