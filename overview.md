3. **tasks.md**: Lists all actionable tasks with their status, priorities, and deadlines
4. **accomplishments.md**: Records completed milestones and achievements
5. **learnings.md**: Documents insights and lessons from our experience
6. **competitor-analysis.md**: Provides detailed analysis of key competitors
7. **seo-strategy.md**: Outlines the digital marketing strategy

## Current Business Status

Signature Med Support is in **Phase 1: Market Differentiation and Service Excellence** with current focus on:

1. **Maintain awareness of our strategic direction** by referencing the master plan when providing advice
2. **Suggest updates to the appropriate files** when new information is shared
3. **Generate comprehensive reports and recommendations** that align with our business goals
4. **Help prioritize tasks and next steps** based on business impact
5. **Analyze market opportunities and challenges** in the travel medical support industry

## How to Provide Help

2. Maintain consistency with our existing strategic direction
3. Provide actionable advice that can be implemented immediately
4. Suggest specific tasks that should be added to tasks.md
5. Recommend updates to files when relevant new information is shared

## Cursor-Optimized Workflow

This project uses Cursor IDE features to enhance productivity and document consistency. Follow these guidelines when working with Cursor:

### YOLO Mode

When YOLO mode is enabled, use this prompt:
```
Automatically update related documents when changes occur according to document-sync rules. Verify document headers are updated with current dates. Maintain consistency across master-plan.md, next-steps.md, and tasks.md. Run document consistency tests when appropriate.
```

### Command K Shortcuts

Use these Command K patterns for quick document updates:

1. **Task Management**:
   - "Move this task to accomplishments" - Transfers completed task to accomplishments.md
   - "Update task status to [status]" - Updates task status in tasks.md
   - "Create tasks from this learning" - Generates actionable tasks from learnings

2. **Document Synchronization**:
   - "Update related documents" - Updates connected documents based on this change
   - "Update header with today's date" - Updates the document header timestamp
   - "Verify consistency with master plan" - Checks alignment with strategic goals

3. **Review Automation**:
   - "Run daily review" - Executes daily review process
   - "Run three-day review" - Performs comprehensive document consistency check
   - "Run weekly assessment" - Conducts strategic assessment

### Terminal Automation

For automated reviews and consistency checks, use the following terminal commands:

```bash
# Run daily review
./scripts/daily-review.sh

# Run comprehensive three-day review
./scripts/three-day-review.sh

# Run weekly strategic assessment
./scripts/weekly-assessment.sh

# Check document consistency
./scripts/check-consistency.sh

# Generate report on current status
./scripts/generate-status-report.sh
```

### Document Testing

When suggesting document updates, verify these key consistency points:

1. Strategic Alignment: All tasks connect to strategic goals
2. Priority Consistency: Task priorities match strategic importance
3. Deadline Validation: All high-priority tasks have deadlines
4. KPI Tracking: All KPIs have measurement mechanisms
5. Terminology Consistency: Consistent terminology is used across documents

## Document Update Protocol

To ensure all documents remain synchronized and up-to-date, follow these protocols:

### Update Triggers

| Event Type | Files to Update | Update Priority |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Task status change | tasks.md, next-steps.md | High |
| Task completion | tasks.md, accomplishments.md | High |
| New insight gained | learnings.md, potentially master-plan.md | Medium |
| Market change | competitor-analysis.md, master-plan.md | Medium |
| Strategic direction change | master-plan.md, next-steps.md, tasks.md | High |
| New priority identified | next-steps.md, tasks.md | High |
| Phase transition | ALL documents | Critical |
| New service/offering | master-plan.md, seo-strategy.md | Medium |

### Responsibility Matrix

- **User**: Approves all strategic changes and phase transitions
- **LLM Assistant**: 
  - Proactively suggests updates to relevant files based on conversations
  - Flags inconsistencies between documents
  - Drafts content for file updates
  - Ensures all file headers contain current update dates

### Regular Review Cycle

- **Daily Review**: 
  - Review and update tasks.md with current statuses
  - Update next-steps.md to reflect current priorities
  - Add new accomplishments and learnings

- **Three-Day Comprehensive Review**:
  - Audit all documents for consistency
  - Verify all strategic goals remain aligned
  - Update master-plan.md if needed to reflect current direction
  - Review competitor and market information for relevance

- **Weekly Strategic Assessment**:
  - Comprehensive review of master-plan.md
  - Evaluate progress toward long-term goals
  - Consider phase transitions if appropriate
  - Update all files to align with strategic direction

### Cross-Referencing System

When updating any document, check for impacts on other documents:

1. Changes to master-plan.md should cascade to next-steps.md and tasks.md
2. Completed tasks should move from tasks.md to accomplishments.md
3. New priorities in next-steps.md should be reflected in tasks.md with specific actions
4. Insights in learnings.md should inform adjustments to master-plan.md and next-steps.md

### Document Headers

All documents must maintain a header comment with:
```
<!-- Purpose: [Brief description of document purpose]. Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD -->
```

The LLM will automatically suggest updating this date whenever file content changes.

### Cursor Rule Automation

The Cursor IDE uses rules in the .cursor/rules/ directory to assist with document synchronization:

- **file-updates.mdc**: Ensures consistent formatting and header updates
- **project-overview.mdc**: Helps the LLM understand document relationships
- **task-template.mdc**: Maintains consistent task recording format
- **business-reports.mdc**: Ensures recommendations align with master plan
- **document-sync.mdc**: Manages cross-document updates and consistency
- **cursor-optimization.mdc**: Provides Cursor-specific optimization rules

The LLM will leverage these rules to suggest appropriate updates and maintain document consistency.

This overview serves as your entry point to understanding and assisting with the Signature Med Support business development process.
