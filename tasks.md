Tasks are categorized into separate files based on strategic goals and initiatives to improve readability, focus, and management. Below, you'll find links to each category file with a brief description and summary of tasks.

## How to Use:
- **Task ID:** Unique identifier for each task following TID-XXX format.
- **Task:** A clear description of what needs to be done.
- **Priority:** High, Medium, Low based on business impact and time-sensitivity.
- **Complexity:** High, Medium, Low based on scope, interdependencies, and required expertise.

## Prioritization Framework: Eisenhower Matrix
- **Urgent + Important (Do First):** High priority tasks that directly impact core service definition and critical infrastructure
- **Important + Not Urgent (Schedule):** Medium-High priority tasks that are important for long-term success
- **Urgent + Not Important (Delegate):** Medium priority tasks that need attention but aren't strategically critical
- **Not Urgent + Not Important (Eliminate/Defer):** Low priority tasks that can be delayed or reconsidered

## Complexity Assessment Guidelines
A task is likely **High Complexity** if it:
- Requires multiple distinct skill sets
- Estimated time exceeds 3 days of work
- Involves multiple stakeholders or dependencies
- Contains multiple deliverables or outcomes
- Includes broad scope (e.g., "develop a system" rather than "configure a component")

High complexity tasks should be considered for breakdown into smaller sub-tasks. When breaking down complex tasks:
1. Create a parent task that describes the overall objective
2. Create multiple child tasks that represent logical components of the parent task
3. Add "Parent Task: [Task ID]" to the Notes field of each child task
4. Add "Child Tasks: [Task IDs]" to the Notes field of the parent task
