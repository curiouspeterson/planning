# Gap Analysis Report

## Overview
This report identifies specific gaps in the Cursor-optimized business planning system for Signature Med Support as of 2025-05-18. It builds on the system analysis report and consistency check results to highlight areas where strategic goals, resources, processes, and task management are incomplete or misaligned.

## Identified Gaps

### 1. Terminology Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: Terms like 'Market' vs. 'Marketing', 'Service' vs. 'Services', and others are used inconsistently across documents, as flagged by the consistency check.
- **Examples**: In `master-plan.md`, 'concierge urgent care Services' (Vision) vs. 'Service Enhancement' (Goals).
- **Impact**: Potential confusion in strategy interpretation and communication.
- **Recommendation**: Standardize terminology across all documents with a defined glossary.

### 2. Learning Implementation Gaps
- **Issue**: Many insights from `learnings.md` are not translated into actionable tasks, especially detailed entries in the 'Learnings Log' table.
- **Examples**: Insights on mobile medical equipment, membership pricing, and market growth lack task implementation notes.
- **Impact**: Missed opportunities to act on critical business insights.
- **Recommendation**: Create tasks for each unaddressed learning with clear priorities and deadlines.

### 3. Resource Gaps
- **Issue**: Resources mentioned in strategic documents lack corresponding tasks in categorized task files.
- **Examples**: 'Proprietary travel risk management platform' and 'specialized medical expertise in remote locations' from `master-plan.md` flagged by consistency check as lacking implementation tasks.
- **Impact**: Delays in strategy execution due to unaddressed resource needs.
- **Recommendation**: Develop specific tasks for resource acquisition or development, categorized appropriately.

### 4. Deadline Coverage Issues
- **Issue**: High-priority task categories across various files lack deadlines, as identified in the consistency check.
- **Examples**: Categories like 'Core Service Definition' (High Priority: 15 tasks) and 'Concierge Urgent Care Service Development' (High Priority: 25 tasks) in `tasks.md` index.
- **Impact**: Risk of delayed progress on critical initiatives.
- **Recommendation**: Assign realistic deadlines to all high-priority tasks and ensure they are tracked.

### 5. Complex Task Management
- **Issue**: High complexity tasks are not consistently broken down into manageable sub-tasks.
- **Examples**: While `tasks.md` provides guidelines for complexity assessment, the consistency check did not identify specific breakdowns for high-priority categories.
- **Impact**: Potential inefficiency or overwhelm in task execution.
- **Recommendation**: Implement automated flagging of complex tasks in scripts and create sub-tasks for each.

### 6. Process Gaps
- **Issue**: Some deliverables and recurring activities lack defined creation or management processes.
- **Examples**: The process for updating `next-steps.md` based on task status changes is not automated or clearly defined.
- **Impact**: Inefficiencies in maintaining system consistency and alignment.
- **Recommendation**: Enhance automation scripts to handle recurring updates and define clear processes for key activities.

## Next Steps
- Prioritize the resolution of these gaps based on strategic impact (e.g., deadline coverage and learning implementation first).
- Develop an improvement plan to address each gap with specific actions, timelines, and responsible parties.
- Update this report as gaps are closed or new ones are identified.

This gap analysis will guide the development of targeted improvements to enhance the effectiveness of the planning system.
