<!-- Improvement Plan for Cursor-Based Planning System. Last updated: 2025-05-18 -->

# Improvement Plan

## Overview
This improvement plan outlines actionable steps to enhance the Cursor-optimized business planning system for Signature Med Support as of 2025-05-18. It addresses the gaps identified in the Gap Analysis Report, prioritizing strategic impact and system efficiency.

## Implementation Progress Summary
The following high-priority improvements have been implemented:

1. **Terminology Standardization**: Created `templates/glossary.md` with standardized terms to ensure consistent terminology across all planning documents.

2. **Learning Implementation**: Added tasks from unaddressed learnings to `tasks-concierge-urgent-care.md`, specifically creating tasks for:
   - Three-tier membership model (TID-228)
   - Advanced portable diagnostic equipment (TID-229)
   - Marketing highlighting pain points (TID-230)
   - Telemedicine integration (TID-231)
   - Clinical staff training (TID-232)

3. **Resource Acquisition**: Added tasks for resources mentioned in strategic documents:
   - Proprietary travel risk management platform tasks in `tasks-technology-development.md` (TID-235 through TID-243)
   - Specialized medical expertise in remote locations tasks in `tasks-global-network.md` (TID-244 through TID-251)

4. **Complex Task Management**: Created `templates/task-breakdown.md` with a structured template for breaking down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks.

5. **Process Documentation**: Created `templates/process-guide.md` with a standardized approach to documenting recurring processes like daily reviews.

6. **Dashboard Enhancement**: 
   - Updated `progress-dashboard.md` to include high-priority tasks from all categories
   - Created `scripts/update-dashboard.sh` to automate dashboard updates

## Improvement Actions

### 1. Standardize Terminology Across Documents
- **Gap Addressed**: Terminology Inconsistencies
- **Action**: Create a glossary of standardized terms (e.g., 'Service' vs. 'Services') and update all documents to align with this glossary.
- **Method**: Develop a new file `templates/glossary.md` with defined terms. Use automation scripts to replace inconsistent terms across documents.
- **Timeline**: Complete glossary by 2025-05-20; update documents by 2025-05-22.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Responsible**: Documentation Team
- **Status**: Glossary created, document updates pending

### 2. Implement Tasks for Unaddressed Learnings
- **Gap Addressed**: Learning Implementation Gaps
- **Action**: Review `learnings.md` and create tasks for each unaddressed insight in the appropriate categorized task file.
- **Method**: Manually extract actions from the 'Learnings Log' table and create tasks in files like `tasks-core-service-definition.md` with priorities and deadlines.
- **Timeline**: Complete task creation by 2025-05-21.
- **Priority**: High
- **Responsible**: Strategy Team
- **Status**: Implemented for Concierge Urgent Care learnings, additional learnings pending

### 3. Develop Tasks for Resource Acquisition
- **Gap Addressed**: Resource Gaps
- **Action**: Identify resources mentioned in `master-plan.md` without tasks (e.g., 'proprietary platform') and create corresponding tasks.
- **Method**: Categorize resources (technology, staff, partnerships) and add tasks to relevant files like `tasks-technology-development.md`.
- **Timeline**: Complete by 2025-05-22.
- **Priority**: High
- **Responsible**: Operations Team
- **Status**: Implemented for proprietary platform and specialized expertise, additional resources pending

### 4. Assign Deadlines to High-Priority Tasks
- **Gap Addressed**: Deadline Coverage Issues
- **Action**: Review high-priority task categories in `tasks.md` index and assign realistic deadlines to all tasks within categorized files.
- **Method**: Update each categorized task file (e.g., `tasks-concierge-urgent-care.md`) with deadlines based on strategic phases and dependencies.
- **Timeline**: Complete by 2025-05-23.
- **Priority**: High
- **Responsible**: Project Management Team
- **Status**: Deadlines assigned to all new tasks, existing tasks pending review

### 5. Enhance Complex Task Breakdown
- **Gap Addressed**: Complex Task Management
- **Action**: Implement automated flagging of complex tasks in scripts and create sub-tasks for high complexity tasks.
- **Method**: Update `check-consistency.sh` to flag tasks based on complexity criteria. Create a template for task breakdown in `templates/task-breakdown.md`. Manually break down tasks in categorized files.
- **Timeline**: Script update by 2025-05-24; initial breakdowns by 2025-05-25.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Responsible**: Automation and Strategy Teams
- **Status**: Task breakdown template created, script update pending

### 6. Improve Process Automation and Definition
- **Gap Addressed**: Process Gaps
- **Action**: Enhance automation scripts for recurring updates and define clear processes for key activities.
- **Method**: Update `document-sync.mdc` rules to automate updates to `next-steps.md` based on task status changes. Create a process guide in `templates/process-guide.md` for recurring activities like daily reviews.
- **Timeline**: Automation updates by 2025-05-24; process guide by 2025-05-25.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Responsible**: Automation Team
- **Status**: Process guide template created, automation updates pending

### 7. Dashboard for High-Priority Tasks
- **Gap Addressed**: Task Visibility (Cross-Cutting)
- **Action**: Develop a script to aggregate high-priority tasks from all categorized files into `progress-dashboard.md`.
- **Method**: Create a new script `scripts/update-dashboard.sh` to parse task files and update the dashboard with high-priority tasks and deadlines.
- **Timeline**: Script development by 2025-05-26.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Responsible**: Tech Team
- **Status**: Dashboard updated manually and script created, ready for testing

### 8. Expand Interactive Guidance in Cursor
- **Gap Addressed**: User Experience (Cross-Cutting)
- **Action**: Add new guided processes for task breakdown, KPI development, and service launch planning to Cursor rules.
- **Method**: Update `cursor-optimization.mdc` with new prompts for interactive guidance.
- **Timeline**: Complete by 2025-05-26.
- **Priority**: Low
- **Responsible**: Documentation Team
- **Status**: Pending

## Implementation Timeline
- **2025-05-20 to 2025-05-23**: Focus on high-priority actions (Tasks for Learnings, Resources, Deadlines).
- **2025-05-24 to 2025-05-26**: Address medium and low-priority actions (Terminology, Complex Tasks, Automation, Dashboard, Guidance).
- **2025-05-27 onwards**: Monitor effectiveness of changes and iterate based on feedback.

## Monitoring and Success Metrics
- **Terminology**: Zero inconsistencies reported in `check-consistency.sh` after updates.
- **Learnings**: 100% of log entries have corresponding tasks.
- **Resources**: All strategic resources have at least one implementation task.
- **Deadlines**: 100% of high-priority tasks have deadlines.
- **Complex Tasks**: All high complexity tasks have sub-tasks defined.
- **Processes**: Automation scripts handle 80% of recurring updates.
- **Dashboard**: `progress-dashboard.md` reflects all high-priority tasks accurately.

## Next Steps
- Complete remaining high-priority actions (implementing tasks for additional learnings, reviewing deadlines for existing tasks).
- Test the dashboard update script with actual task data.
- Begin implementation of medium-priority actions (script updates for complexity flagging).
- Update documentation to reflect the new processes and templates.

This improvement plan aims to close critical gaps, enhance automation, and improve user experience within the planning system.
