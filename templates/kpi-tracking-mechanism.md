# KPI Tracking Mechanism Template
<!-- Created: This template provides a standardized format for documenting how each KPI will be measured, tracked, and reported, ensuring all strategic goals have concrete measurement systems in place for accountability. Last updated: 2025-05-17 -->

## Purpose
Use this template to define specific tracking mechanisms for each KPI in your strategic plan. This ensures that all goals have clear, measurable outcomes and establishes accountability for monitoring progress.

## How to Use
1. Complete one KPI tracking mechanism document for each KPI in master-plan.md
2. Link to specific strategic goals and objectives
3. Define data sources, measurement frequency, and reporting processes
4. Assign clear ownership for each tracking mechanism
5. Review and update quarterly or when strategic goals change
