# Planning Assumptions Template
<!-- Created: This template provides a standardized format for documenting critical assumptions that underlie business plans and strategy documents, enabling better tracking, validation, and risk assessment. Last updated: 2025-05-17 -->

## Purpose
Use this template within strategic documents to clearly identify and track the key assumptions that underlie plans and projections. This ensures transparency about what is known versus what is assumed, and facilitates later validation of these assumptions.

## How to Use
1. Include this section in all strategic planning documents
2. Document all significant assumptions that impact planning decisions
3. Categorize assumptions based on confidence level
4. Regularly review and update as assumptions are validated or invalidated
5. Reference these assumptions when evaluating plan performance

## Validation Plan
- Prioritize assumptions for validation based on:
  - Impact on plan success if wrong
  - Level of uncertainty
  - Cost/effort to validate
- Document validation methods and timelines
- Assign responsibility for validation to specific team members
- Create feedback loop for updating plans based on validation results

## Risk Assessment
For high-impact assumptions with medium or low confidence:
- Document specific risks if assumption is wrong
- Define early warning indicators
- Develop contingency plans
- Identify triggers for plan adjustment

## Confidence Level Definitions
- **High Confidence:** Strong evidence supports this assumption; unlikely to change
- **Medium Confidence:** Reasonable evidence supports this assumption, but some uncertainty exists
- **Low Confidence:** Limited evidence supports this assumption; significant uncertainty exists
